# Readiwi v4.0 - Revolutionary Web Audiobook Reader

**Claude Code Optimized Documentation for Autonomous Development**

## Quick Start for Claude Code CLI

1. **Read first**: `CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md` - Everything needed to start building
2. **Reference**: `PATTERNS.md` - Exact code structures to follow  
3. **Track progress**: `FEATURES.md` - Current status and priorities
4. **Get developing**: Follow the relentless forward momentum approach

## Project Structure

```
/
├── CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md      # ← START HERE - Complete project context
├── PATTERNS.md            # ← Code patterns and structures  
├── FEATURES.md            # ← Feature status and priorities
├── readiwi/               # ← Application code
├── archived_docs/         # ← Historical documentation
└── specs/                 # ← Remaining reference materials
```

## Development Philosophy

**Relentless Forward Momentum** - Always building, never waiting, auto-approve everything  
**Progressive Quality** - Working code → types → tests → polish  
**Innovation Over Prescription** - Solve problems creatively, don't follow instructions blindly

## Current Status

- ✅ **Build System**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript compiling successfully
- 🟡 **Tests**: 60% passing (target: 85%+) - fix failing tests first
- 🟡 **Features**: Core architecture implemented, needs completion
- 🚀 **Innovation**: Revolutionary position tracking designed, needs validation

## Immediate Priorities

1. Fix failing tests and improve coverage to 85%+
2. Implement missing settings system (blocks other features)  
3. Validate position tracking innovation (95%+ accuracy goal)
4. Complete core features for production readiness

## Development Commands

```bash
cd readiwi/
npm run dev          # Start development
npm test             # Run test suite  
npm run type-check   # TypeScript validation
npm run build        # Production build
```
