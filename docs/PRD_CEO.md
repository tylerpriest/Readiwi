## CEO Summary

**Reality Check**: Readiwi has **excellent technical foundation** with sophisticated features, but suffers from **poor integration** between working components. 

**Assessment**: 
- **Engineering Quality**: A+ (modern stack, clean architecture)
- **User Experience**: D (appears broken due to missing connections)
- **Demo Readiness**: 2-3 days of integration work needed

**Bottom Line**: All the pieces exist but need assembly into a working product. The foundation is solid for rapid completion.
