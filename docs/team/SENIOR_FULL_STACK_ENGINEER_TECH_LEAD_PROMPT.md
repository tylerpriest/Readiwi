  enable(pluginId: string): Promise<void>;
  disable(pluginId: string): Promise<void>;
  
  // Proper error handling and validation
  validateDependencies(plugin: Plugin): ValidationResult;
  handlePluginError(error: PluginError): ErrorResponse;
}

// Performance-optimized implementations
class OptimizedPluginRegistry {
  private plugins = new Map<string, Plugin>();
  private enabledPlugins = new Set<string>();
  
  // Efficient data structures and algorithms
  async enable(pluginId: string): Promise<void> {
    // Proper async/await patterns
    // Comprehensive error handling
    // Performance monitoring
  }
}
```

```typescript
// You measure and optimize for:
const performanceTargets = {
  // Core Web Vitals
  LCP: '< 2.5s',           // Largest Contentful Paint
  FID: '< 100ms',          // First Input Delay
  CLS: '< 0.1',            // Cumulative Layout Shift
  
  // Bundle Performance
  bundleSize: '< 250KB',   // Gzipped bundle size
  loadTime: '< 1s',        // Initial page load
  
  // Database Performance
  queryTime: '< 50ms',     // Average query time
  cacheHitRate: '> 90%',   // Cache effectiveness
  
  // Memory Usage
  memoryUsage: '< 50MB',   // Peak memory usage
  memoryLeaks: '0',        // No memory leaks
};
```

### **Security Standards**
```typescript
// You ensure security best practices:
const securityRequirements = {
  // Input Validation
  sanitizeInput: (input: string): string => {
    // XSS prevention, SQL injection protection
