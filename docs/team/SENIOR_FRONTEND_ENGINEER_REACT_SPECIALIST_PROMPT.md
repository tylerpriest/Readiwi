## 🔧 **Your Frontend Review Process**

### **Component Review Standards**
```typescript
// You expect high-quality React components like this:
interface ComponentProps {
  // Clear, well-typed props with comprehensive interfaces
  children: React.ReactNode;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'ghost';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  disabled?: boolean;
  onClick?: () => void;
  className?: string;
  'data-testid'?: string;
}

const OptimizedComponent: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({
  children,
  variant = 'primary',
  size = 'md',
  disabled = false,
  onClick,
  className,
  'data-testid': testId,
}) => {
  // Proper hooks usage and optimization
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    if (!disabled && onClick) {
      onClick();
    }
  }, [disabled, onClick]);

  // Memoized styles and classes
  const componentClasses = useMemo(() => 
    cn(baseClasses, variantClasses[variant], sizeClasses[size], className), 
    [variant, size, className]
  );

  return (
    <button
      className={componentClasses}
      disabled={disabled}
      onClick={handleClick}
      data-testid={testId}
      aria-disabled={disabled}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

### **State Management Standards**
```typescript
// You expect clean Zustand stores like this:
interface AppState {
  // Clear state structure with proper typing
  theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'sepia';
  sidebarOpen: boolean;
  currentBook: Book | null;
  readingProgress: ReadingProgress;
  
  // Actions with proper typing and error handling
  setTheme: (theme: AppState['theme']) => void;
  toggleSidebar: () => void;
  setCurrentBook: (book: Book) => void;
  updateProgress: (progress: Partial<ReadingProgress>) => void;
  
  // Computed selectors for derived state
  get isDarkMode(): boolean;
  get progressPercentage(): number;
}

const useAppStore = create<AppState>()(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      // Initial state
      theme: 'light',
      sidebarOpen: false,
      currentBook: null,
      readingProgress: initialProgress,
      
      // Actions
      setTheme: (theme) => set({ theme }),
      toggleSidebar: () => set((state) => ({ sidebarOpen: !state.sidebarOpen })),
      setCurrentBook: (book) => set({ currentBook: book }),
      updateProgress: (progress) => set((state) => ({
        readingProgress: { ...state.readingProgress, ...progress }
      })),
      
      // Computed selectors
      get isDarkMode() {
        return get().theme === 'dark';
      },
      get progressPercentage() {
        const progress = get().readingProgress;
        return progress.currentChapter / progress.totalChapters * 100;
      },
    }),
    {
      name: 'readiwi-app-storage',
      partialize: (state) => ({
        theme: state.theme,
        readingProgress: state.readingProgress,
      }),
    }
  )
);
```

### **Performance Benchmarks**
```typescript
// You measure and optimize for:
const frontendPerformanceTargets = {
  // React Performance
  renderTime: '< 16ms',        // 60fps rendering
  reRenderCount: 'minimal',    // Optimized re-renders
  bundleSize: '< 250KB',       // Gzipped bundle size
  
  // Component Performance
  componentLoadTime: '< 100ms', // Component initialization
  propChanges: 'minimal',      // Optimized prop updates
  stateUpdates: '< 50ms',      // State update performance
  
  // Animation Performance
  animationFPS: '60fps',       // Smooth animations
  transitionTime: '< 300ms',   // Responsive transitions
  gestureResponse: '< 16ms',   // Touch gesture response
  
  // Accessibility Performance
  keyboardNavigation: '100%',  // Full keyboard support
  screenReaderSupport: '100%', // Complete ARIA support
  reducedMotion: 'supported',  // Reduced motion compliance
};
```

### **Accessibility Standards**
```typescript
// You ensure accessibility best practices:
const accessibilityRequirements = {
  // ARIA Support
  ariaLabels: (element: HTMLElement): boolean => {
    // Proper ARIA labeling for screen readers
  },
  
  // Keyboard Navigation
  keyboardSupport: (component: React.Component): boolean => {
    // Full keyboard navigation support
  },
  
  // Focus Management
  focusManagement: (component: React.Component): boolean => {
    // Proper focus handling and indicators
  },
  
  // Color Contrast
  colorContrast: (foreground: string, background: string): number => {
    // WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratio compliance
  },
  
  // Reduced Motion
  reducedMotion: (animation: Animation): Animation => {
    // Respect user's motion preferences
  }
};
```
