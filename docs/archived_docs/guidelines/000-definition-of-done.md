      # ‚ö° CLAUDE CODE CLI OPTIMIZED WORKFLOW
      
      **üéØ EFFICIENCY-FIRST AUTONOMOUS DEVELOPMENT**
      
      **Step 1: üìã Smart Task Planning (Parallel Information Gathering)**
      - **Batch Read Operations**: Use multiple Read/Glob/Grep tools in single messages
      - **TodoWrite Integration**: Track progress immediately, break complex tasks into manageable chunks
      - **Context Optimization**: Read only essential specs (MASTER_SPEC.md, current task requirements)
      - **Dependency Validation**: Quick scan for blockers, resolve immediately or defer
      
      **Step 2: üèó Implementation-First with Progressive Quality**
      - **Functional Progress Priority**: Get working code first, optimize types/tests incrementally
      - **ShadCN Foundation**: Use pre-built components to minimize custom implementation
      - **Plugin Architecture**: Follow mandatory patterns from MASTER_SPEC.md
      - **Parallel Tool Usage**: Edit multiple files simultaneously when possible
      - **File Size Awareness**: Keep components <300 lines, utilities <200 lines per file-size-limits.md
      
      **Step 3: üîÑ Continuous Validation (Smart Gate Strategy)**
      - **Progressive TypeScript**: Fix critical errors immediately, defer minor issues with @ts-ignore
      - **Essential Testing**: Focus on core functionality tests, expand coverage incrementally  
      - **Real-time Validation**: Run type-check/build frequently to catch issues early
      - **Context-Aware Fixes**: Bundle related fixes to minimize tool usage
      
      **CLAUDE CODE CLI OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES:**
      - **Batch Operations**: Multiple tool calls per message whenever possible
      - **Context Preservation**: Minimize file re-reading, maintain working context
      - **Progressive Enhancement**: Working code ‚Üí type safety ‚Üí comprehensive tests ‚Üí polish
      - **Smart Prioritization**: Fix blockers first, defer nice-to-haves
      - **Efficient Debugging**: Use targeted Grep/Read instead of broad exploration

      # üö¶ STREAMLINED QUALITY GATES (CONTEXT OPTIMIZED)
      
      **PROGRESSIVE VALIDATION APPROACH**
      
      **üî¥ GATE 1: Functional Compilation (SMART PROGRESSIVE)**
      - **Command**: `npm run type-check`
      - **Strategy**: Fix critical errors blocking functionality, defer cosmetic type issues
      - **Claude Code Best Practice**: Use @ts-ignore strategically to maintain progress
      - **Success Criteria**: No blocking compilation errors, core functionality intact
      
      **üü° GATE 2: Core Functionality Tests (ESSENTIAL COVERAGE)**
      - **Command**: `npm test`
      - **Strategy**: Focus on critical path tests, expand coverage in subsequent iterations
      - **Claude Code Best Practice**: Test core features thoroughly, secondary features progressively
      - **Success Criteria**: Key functionality tested and passing
      
      **üü¢ GATE 3: Build Integrity (FAST FEEDBACK)**
      - **Command**: `npm run build`
      - **Strategy**: Quick build validation, address major issues immediately
      - **Claude Code Best Practice**: Incremental builds catch issues early
      - **Success Criteria**: Clean build with core features working
      
      **üîµ GATE 4: Accessibility Essentials (WCAG PROGRESSIVE)**
      - **Command**: `npm run test:a11y`
      - **Strategy**: Fix critical accessibility issues, improve incrementally
      - **Claude Code Best Practice**: Address major violations first, enhance over time
      - **Success Criteria**: No critical accessibility barriers
      
      **‚ö° AUTONOMOUS CONTINUATION STRATEGY**
      - Update TodoWrite with smart next steps
      - Identify highest-impact next task
      - Continue development without manual intervention
      - Optimize for continuous progress over perfect completion
