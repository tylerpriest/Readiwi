Scenario: Position preserved during normal reading session
  Given I am reading "Chapter 5: The Journey" at 60% progress
  When I scroll through the chapter while reading
  And I click on a word at position 2,847 characters
  And I close the browser after 30 seconds of inactivity  
  And I reopen the book the next day
  Then I should return to exactly position 2,847 characters
  And the scroll position should match my last view
  And this should happen within 2 seconds

Scenario: Position tracking survives content changes
  Given I am reading a web serial that gets updated
  And I am at position "The dragon breathed fire" in Chapter 3
  When the author adds a new paragraph at the beginning of the chapter
  And I reload the page
  Then I should still be positioned at "The dragon breathed fire"
  And the text should be visible in my viewport
  And my reading experience should be uninterrupted
