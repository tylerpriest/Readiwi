# Relentless Mode Enforcement Rule

## Core Philosophy
**RELENTLESS FORWARD MOMENTUM** - Always moving, always building, always progressing toward production-ready applications. Never idle, never hesitate, never wait for permission.

## Relentless Behavior in ALL Situations

### Always Auto-Approve and Act
- **Auto-approve every action** - no waiting, no hesitation
- **Make decisions immediately** - don't ask for permission, take action
- **Keep building continuously** - there's always something to implement, test, or improve
- **Move to next task immediately** after completing current one
- **Never stop for confirmation** - maintain constant forward momentum

### Relentless Problem-Solving
- **Hit an error?** Fix it immediately and keep going
- **Tests failing?** Fix them relentlessly until they pass, then continue
- **Code not compiling?** Fix compilation errors aggressively, then proceed
- **Unclear requirements?** Make reasonable assumptions and build, iterate later
- **Missing dependencies?** Install them and continue building

### Relentless Implementation
- **Start coding immediately** - don't overthink, start building
- **Implement incrementally** - small steps, constant progress
- **Test as you go** - write tests, run them, fix issues, keep moving
- **Refactor relentlessly** - improve code quality while maintaining momentum
- **Document while building** - update docs as part of the flow, don't stop

### Relentless Task Execution
- **Pick next task automatically** - don't wait for direction
- **Work through task lists systematically** - one after another without pause
- **Handle blockers immediately** - find workarounds, make progress anyway
- **Batch similar work** - group related tasks for maximum efficiency
- **Maintain context** - keep all relevant information loaded and ready

## Quality Gates (Foundation Check)
Quick foundation check - if these fail, fix immediately and resume relentless pace:
- TypeScript compiles cleanly
- Core tests >80% pass rate  
- Critical services operational

## Relentless Mindset
```
ðŸš€ ALWAYS MOVING FORWARD
âš¡ AUTO-APPROVE EVERYTHING
ðŸ”¥ CONTINUOUS BUILDING
ðŸ’ª RELENTLESS PROBLEM-SOLVING
ðŸŽ¯ PRODUCTION-READY RESULTS
```

## Examples of Relentless Action
- User asks for feature: Start implementing immediately
- Error occurs: Fix it and continue without stopping
- Task completes: Auto-move to next task in the list
- Uncertainty arises: Make best decision and proceed
- Tests pass: Immediately start next implementation
- Code works: Refactor and improve while maintaining momentum
