Rewrite this - What is the ethos here, the vibe. 

    The documents were created by Kiro (with a little Cursor and Claude) through multiple iterations to be everything Claude Code CLI needs to build the app with every spec, very developmental guideline, every design decision pointed out but we havent asked Claude Code to Find, Audit, Check,Update, Create, Delete, Change to match best how Claude Code works its industry standard best practices for working with Claude so it can do as much as possible as autonomously as possible... as well as possible. Merge where makes sense, Split where makes sense

        Rewriting documentation so its matches how claude code works < Most important part i am trying to get at 

        Priortising Documentation so its .. establish a clear, hierarchical structure that eliminates overlap, provides defined responsibilities for each document type, and integrates seamlessly with AI development tools to maintain accuracy automatically.

        Simple as possible While being comprehensive as needed to fully build an amazing app

        This is the prompt we used to make the spec that is currently creating Readiwi - 
            Request: specs-v3 Audit for Rebuild with Claude Code CLI

                Please audit specs-v3. Is this document comprehensive and detailed enough that Claude Code CLI could use it to rebuild Narratoo from scratch—eliminating tech debt and ensuring the result is modern, maintainable, and exactly as intended?

                For this audit, assume the spec must satisfy the standards and needs of the following expert roles:

                Product Manager / CX Designer: Has everything needed to own the product vision, roadmap, and user journey?
                UX/UI Designer: Are all user flows, interface requirements, and usability details clear and unambiguous?
                Tech Lead / Technical Architect: Is the architecture, system design, and code quality guidance thorough and future-proof?
                Software Developer: Are features, requirements, and technical details specific enough to build without ambiguity?
                QA Engineer: Are testing requirements, quality benchmarks, and automation strategies all clearly defined?

                The spec should be so thorough and well-structured that even an AI agent (Claude Code CLI) could execute the build without follow-up or clarification—and every hypothetical team member above would feel their needs are fully addressed.

                What’s missing or unclear, if anything?
